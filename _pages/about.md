Humans interact with the world as they move through and engage with their surroundings. There is a vast potential to improve these interactions through research aimed at developing vision-based cooking-, voice-, fitness-, health-, driving-, embodied- assistants. Such assistants could help us by providing interactive and detailed instructions in real-time or by taking over daily life tasks. This workshop seeks to serve as a forum for discussing challenges of developing vision-based assistants for daily tasks. To this end, the VAR workshop features an exciting lineup of speakers and live demonstrations of vision-based assistants (see [Call for Demos and Papers](/al-folio/DemosandPapers/)).
Additionally, as there are limited datasets and benchmarks for real-world vision-based assistants, the VAR workshop will host two challenges designed to foster the development of real-world vision-based assistants (see [Challenges](/al-folio/Challenges/)).
