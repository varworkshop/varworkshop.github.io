We invite submissions of extended abstracts and encourage extended abstract submissions to be accompanied by a demo during the workshop. While live demosâ€”such as web-based ones or those running on hardware like phones or laptops are highly encouraged, for this first edition of the workshop, video demos will also be accepted to accommodate any challenges participants may face in transporting their demo setups or devices to the workshop. The review process will be double-blind. Participants will be asked to upload their extended abstract (with demo plans) to CMT.
